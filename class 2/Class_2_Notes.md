```
mkdir Assignments
#echo "Creating Assignments directory..."
```

#You can also creare a directory with a specific path by passing an argument to the script.

#For example, to create a directory named "MyDirectory", you can run:

```
mkdir -p Assignments/MyDirectory
#echo "Creating MyDirectory inside Assignments directory..."
```

```
ls -l
```
