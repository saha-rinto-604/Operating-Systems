The poet walks alone under the silver moon  
Whispers of dreams follow the poet’s tune  
A river hums softly, knowing the poet’s heart  
Every poet carries worlds they’ll never depart  

Stars listen closely when a traveler speaks  
The wind turns gentle on the dreamer’s cheeks  
In quiet nights, stories take their flight  
And dawn returns, painting the sky with light
